most of the mocap files have been copied from the official DeepMimic project: https://github.com/xbpeng/DeepMimic.
The vaulting.txt and jump_and_roll.txt have been created with https://github.com/BartMoyaers/BvhToDeepMimic.
They are based on BvH files from the SFU mocap database http://mocap.cs.sfu.ca/.
