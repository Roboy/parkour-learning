# Parkour learning repository

The goal of this project is to train a humanoid robot in simulation on an obstacle course. 
This is done by first training primitive policies on mimicking motion
capture data from real humans (see https://xbpeng.github.io/projects/DeepMimic/index.html).
We use the multiplicate compositional policies scheme to combine these policies (https://xbpeng.github.io/projects/MCP/index.html).
